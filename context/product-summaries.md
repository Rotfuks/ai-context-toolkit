## 1. Issue Creation System

### Value Pitch
Transform technical backlog items into customer-centric, business-value-driven GitHub issues that clearly communicate outcomes and accelerate team alignment. Stop wasting time on unclear requirements - create issues that engineers understand in under 2 minutes.

### Short Description

The system takes raw technical requirements and transforms them into structured issues with clear motivation, actionable todos, measurable acceptance criteria, and explicit customer value. It enforces consistent formatting, appropriate team labeling, and business-value framing across all issues.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Outcome-oriented title generation using action verbs (Improve, Enable, Reduce, Eliminate, Accelerate)
- Structured issue templates with Motivation, Todo, Outcome, and Acceptance Criteria sections
- Customer-centric framing that connects technical work to business impact
- Team label enforcement and assignment workflow
- Built-in quality checklist preventing common anti-patterns

### Tool Stack
| Tool | Purpose |

## 2. LinkedIn Ghostwriter

### Value Pitch
Create authentic, engaging LinkedIn content that sounds exactly like you wrote it - even when you didn't. Build your personal brand and thought leadership presence without the time investment of writing every post yourself.

### Short Description
An AI voice-cloning system specifically trained on Dominik Schmidle's LinkedIn writing style. The system analyzes writing samples to extract quantitative and qualitative markers (tone, sentence length, vocabulary, humor, formality, structure) and generates new content that matches the authentic voice perfectly. It includes a micro-refinement loop that iteratively improves each draft until it's indistinguishable from human-written content.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Voice DNA extraction from writing samples
- Style metrics tracking (tone, sentence length, vocabulary, humor density)
- LinkedIn-native formatting (no markdown, strategic emoji use, hashtag strategy)
- Iterative refinement with confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Platform-specific content optimization for LinkedIn engagement

### Tool Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AI/LLM** | Voice cloning and content generation |
| **LinkedIn** | Publishing platform |
| **Writing Samples Database** | Style calibration and voice matching |

## 3. One-Pager Creation System

### Value Pitch
Generate professional, sales-ready marketing one-pagers for platform engineering products in minutes instead of days. Consistent Giant Swarm brand voice, proven structural patterns, and customer-focused messaging that converts.

### Short Description

The system follows a proven 6-section structure (Opening Hook, Value Proposition, Why Giant Swarm, Technical Solution, How It Works, Call-to-Action) that positions Giant Swarm as the strategic third option between expensive DIY and inadequate alternatives. It emphasizes platform engineering expertise, time-to-value acceleration, and control/sovereignty messaging.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Problem-first narrative structure positioning Giant Swarm as strategic solution
- Pre-defined value proposition templates (Acceleration, Expertise, Sovereignty, Focused Solution)

## 4. Talk Abstract Creation System

### Value Pitch
Create conference-ready talk abstracts that stand out in competitive CFP reviews - in 2 hours instead of 2 days. AI-powered voice cloning ensures authentic Dominik Schmidle style, while objective scoring guarantees quality before submission.

### Short Description
A two-agent AI system for creating high-quality conference talk abstracts. The **Generator Agent** creates abstracts following detailed voice/style guidelines extracted from Dominik's approved submissions. The **Judge Agent** objectively scores abstracts using a 110-point evaluation system covering style authenticity, content quality, professional standards, and impact potential. The system iterates until abstracts score 85+ points (publication-ready).

**Key Capabilities:**
- 8-step creation workflow from context gathering to submission package
- Voice DNA matching with 90%+ authenticity target
- 5 title formula patterns proven to get CFP acceptances
- 4-paragraph abstract structure (Hook → Insight → Content → Value)
- 110-point objective scoring across 15 metrics
- Conference-specific adaptations (KubeCon, ProductOwnerDays, OSMC, etc.)

**Critical Rule:** Never invents information - all numbers and specifics must be real and provided.

### Tool Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AI/LLM (Generator)** | Abstract creation and voice cloning |
| **AI/LLM (Judge)** | Quality evaluation and scoring |
| **Talk Examples Database** | Voice calibration and pattern reference |
| **Evaluation Metrics Framework** | Objective 110-point scoring system |
