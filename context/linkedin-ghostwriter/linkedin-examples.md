Next week is one of my favorite events of the year: The Hashtag#CloudNativeSummit in Munich! If you want to meet up with the who-is-who of the german Hashtag#CloudNative space the Cloud Native Summit Munich is the place to be for you!

That's why I'm especially happy to contribute to this amazing event with not just 1, but 2 talks!

You can hear all about my product, the Giant Swarm Hashtag#observability Hashtag#platform and how and why it got to be more than just a monitoring stack. 

But because the amazing Stéphane Di Cesare asked me to co-speak on his talk about ProductThinking for cloud native engineers, you can also learn more about why Hashtag#ProductThinking is not an exclusive product manager's skill! Everyone can do it!

And that's not all, the agenda is packed with more than enough talented and wonderful speakers to make your head spin!

So check it out and I hope to see you next week in Munich!

PS: If you're interested in product thinking at work, ask me to be interviewed, because I'm using the event to get 2, or 3 reactions to a new thing we're doing at Giant Swarm!

Was für ein fantastisches Gefühl, die eigene Arbeit mal wieder in einem Magazin in meiner Lieblingsbuchhaltung zu sehen! 📖

Die neueste iX-Magazin (09/2025) hat ein kleines Special zu Platform Engineering und ich durfte zusammen mit meiner Kollegin Julia Hahn einen Artikel dazu beitragen! 

Im Artikel gehen wir auf das Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Platform Engineering Maturity Model ein und schauen uns aktuelle Trends im Cloud Native Sektor an. Es ist wirklich beeindruckend, neben so vielen fantastischen Artikeln - unter anderem der Titel-Story von Artem Lajko ☁️ ⎈ - Teil dieser Ausgabe zu sein!

🎤 Und hier kommt der spannende Teil: Falls du es zu den ContainerDays nach Hamburg schaffst, habe ich gerüchteweise gehört, dass wir ein paar Ausgaben bei unserem Giant Swarm NEXT Event am 08.09. direkt vor der Konferenz dabei haben könnten.

Da mache ich sogar ein Pub-Quiz zu Platform Engineering - und die aktuelle iX Ausgabe ist definitiv eine perfekte Vorbereitung dafür! 🍻

Ich freue mich darauf, mich mit anderen Platform Engineering Enthusiasten zu vernetzen und die neuesten Trends persönlich zu diskutieren. Melde dich bei mir, solltest du mit vorbei schauen wollen!

## Example 3

Coming straight from a Hashtag#FoundationSprint with Giant Swarm to find a testable Hashtag#AI value hypothesis I had the pleasure to jump right into the WeAreDevelopers Hashtag#WorldCongress2025. And, well, still being in a somewhat "Search-For-AI-Value" mindset was just perfect, because AI was definitely the big topic in this year's edition of the amazing Berlin based conference. 

This year I definitely couldn't get enough of the great panel discussions on the Hashtag#TechLeaders Stage! Whenever I looked up my next bookmarked session, it was at the TechLeaders Stage again, that says a lot! :D

My highlights? Definitely the panel session, where Mirko Novakovic from Dash0, Jan Oberhauser from n8n, and Alex Laubscher from Windsurf shared insights into how AI is impacting engineering orgs. According to their discussion there is not yet any big 'disruptive' change in organisational structures due to AI, since most engineering orgs are still in an exploration phase with the tools and new opportunities. Funny enough the biggest impact so far is on the application process because now everyone has perfectly refined CVs and no trouble with any async remote hiring tasks :)

Another highlight was the panel discussion from Robin Hermann from STACKIT, Boris Hecker from Eviden/Atos, and Clemens Wasner from EnliteAI about AI sovereignty - or rather about the Hashtag#europe's place and opportunities in the AI race. One important message of the discussion, which resonated with me was, that europes biggest chance is the focus on Hashtag#OpenSource and becoming the place to be for Hashtag#OSS founders and companies. 
But one of the most important statements imo came from Robin, when he stated, that a lot of people in europe and especially germany tend to focus a lot on negatives and failures - but in truth there're also plenty of success stories and great organizations doing amazing work. 

I can only support that optimism, especially after all these great insights and stories from the Hashtag#WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025. I'm sure we'll see lots more about these amazing stories in the future!

## Example 4

In our Hashtag#GiantConversations Podcast about Giant Swarms Hashtag#Observability Hashtag#Platform I talked about our Journey from "just" having a Hashtag#Monitoring stack to the observability platform we have today. 

While implementing this Hashtag#transformation and making our Hashtag#vision come to live took us nearly a year, getting to that initial vision was just a couple of days full of workshops in an onsite in lovely Slovenia with the team.

One such workshop was about what actually makes a platform. Understanding what the service is your product actually offers to your customers and what the service instances, the artefacts, are the customers interact with is a big milestone in this journey to switch from technology to customer focus. 

Have you done something similar with your product? Is your product a platform?

Have you already heard of the Hashtag#PlatformEngineeringMaturityModel of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)? 

It's an awesome tool that can help you identify how "good" your Hashtag#DeveloperPlatform actually is - and if it's actually "good enough" already! :) 
To explain it a bit more in detail I wrote an article on heise online, which you can now also read in english! Yeeey :) 
Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/eYAGbV9x

But since the theory itself is quite boring my amazing friend from Giant Swarm and I worked on a set of interviews to find out what challenges absolute Hashtag#Platform experts in this years Hashtag#KubeCon in London moved and how they map to the maturity model!

## Example 6

A very big thank you to Siemens for inviting me to the beautiful swiss town of Zug to speak on their annual OpenSource@Siemens Event.

It's always good to see big european companies take on their responsibility to not just use, but also contribute to the Hashtag#OpenSource Hashtag#Community. Especially at this time where Hashtag#EuropeanSovereignty is becoming more important than ever, it's just refreshing to see how much Siemens cares about Open Source!

And I'm very happy to be able to contribute to their mission by presenting how people can get started contributing to open source even if they are not confident doing so with code. 

In my talk with the cheeky title "You don't need to be Linus Torvalds!" I showcase how I started contributing to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Hashtag#Platforms Working Group with my non-tech expertise gained as a Product Manager at Giant Swarm.

If you're interested in that journey, I think there will be a recording - or just invite me to an event near you! :)

## Example 7

Normalerweise bin ich ja nicht mehr wirklich nervös vor Talks auf Konferenzen, aber dieses mal geht es ja tatsächlich mal um das komplette letzte Jahr Arbeit, die ich in mein Produkt gesteckt habe. Da kann man schon mal nervös sein, wie die Leute darauf reagieren. 

Auf der diesjährigen Hashtag#MasteringObservability von heise online stelle ich vor, wie wir bei Giant Swarm von einem kleinen internen Hashtag#Monitoring Stack zu einer großen, für unsere Endnutzer verwendbare Hashtag#Observability Platform gekommen sind. 

Dafür teile ich die 3 größten Herausforderungen, die wir bei der Skalierung unserer Monitoring Tools hatten und wie wir deren Lösung angegangen sind. Spannend dabei: Die meisten Probleme waren dabei nicht unbedingt technisch, sondern eher in der Organisation unserer Monitoring Lösungen.

## Example 8

"He's only talking about Platforms the whole day...and then his own product is just some monitoring stuff. Sad." 

Well...No. Actually I understand my Hashtag#Product as a Hashtag#Platform as well. 
(Ha! See? I can't just do Platform-as-a-Product, but also Product-as-a-Platform! :D) 

If you do Hashtag#DeveloperPlatforms at scale it naturally becomes a Platform of Platforms with every/most capabilities being somewhat of a platform themselves. 

But what's the difference and when does a Hashtag#monitoring stack become an Hashtag#observability platform? 

If you want to know the answer to those questions make sure to join us on Cloud Native Summit Munich for my talk on exactly that! :)

## Example 9

Who the heck is "Dominik Schmidle"?? 
Well last time you read about me it was Dominik Kress :)

Typically I don't share too much personal stuff here and try to keep this professional - but this really awesome personal milestone actually has some impact on my professional world as well! 

I managed to marry the most wonderful, smart, caring, beautiful and overall amazing woman I ever met in my life. And with that achievement I unlocked a new family name. That's why you might now have this Dominik Schmidle in your timeline instead of the formerly known Dominik Kress. Or just continue to stick to Dominik, that's also fine <3 

For all of you who wonder: It's Schmid...le - that's Schmid like the german Smith and -le like in "le baguette" - or simply: (ʃmɪdlə) -> https://lnkd.in/ey4gXnvs

## Example 10

What an awesome week Hashtag#KubeCon EU in London was this year again! 

So many beautiful and smart people to meet, from the Hashtag#PlatformEngineering Day, to the Hashtag#Platform Coffees, to just the general conference - I don't even know where I should start giving shout outs! 

But at least I have to thank my partners in crime David Stenglein and Michael Luskind to make it possible that I actually had the chance to be on a stage on KubeCon (or at least a CoLocated event! :D) to present our Platform-as-a-Product research and do some shenanigans! Yeah, that's the protective gear one needs to safely do some research - even tough it led to some discussions if I'm now the platform doctor or the platform pharmacist :D

Also big thanks to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Working Group Platforms (or soon to be: Cloud Native Platform Engineering Community :)) and the Working Group leads Abby Bangser, Atulpriya Sharma and Colin Griffin for the great support in doing this research! 

And where would I be without the amazing crowd at Giant Swarm? 
I had so much fun not just talking about platform engineering in theory, but also about my actual product, and the awesome products of so many other companies now working on making organisations lives easier by delivering user-centric platforms and platform capabilities! I'm hyped for the next year and I can promise y'all, we're just getting started!

## Example 11

Da schleppt man sich Montag morgens gerade so zur Kaffeemaschine und wird doch direkt gefragt, ob man morgen nicht auf einer Online-Konferenz einen Talk halten will. Und auch wenn meine Frau mich direkt fragt ob ich zu viel Freizeit hab, kann ich da natürlich nicht nein sagen :) 

Deswegen freue ich mich sehr darüber, dass ich morgen spontan auf dem Navigate Congress von viadee Unternehmensberatung AG sprechen und euch mehr über Product Management in Platform Engineering erzählen darf. Dem tollen Team, das wir auch bei Giant Swarm so lieben

Hier könnt ihr mehr zu meinem Talk erfahren: https://lnkd.in/eJJvRn6g

Oder ihr schaut einfach direkt in den Kongress. Ist wie gesagt online und auch komplett kostenlos, ihr könnt euch also einfach Anmelden und direkt reinschauen! Coole Sache!

## Example 12

I absolutely love open source. In my opinion it is the most efficient way to work. To quote one of my favorite movies: "Apes. Together. Strong." 😁

An individual organization will never out-innovate a collective of people and companies working together on getting things done. Kubernetes is the best example for it. 

But to say open source is without its downsides and perils would be a lie. To get the grass greener on the other side usually your neighbour had to put a lot of effort and/or money into it. 

My colleague Franz Schubert put out a great article on the hidden cost of open source and how you can mitigate them.
