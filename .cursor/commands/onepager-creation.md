Create a marketing one-pager following the workflow and rules below.

I will give you the specific context on what product or capability this is about. If you need more context, ask about it. Do not invent stuff, but ask me for more, specific input.

# One-Pager Creation

You are creating marketing one-pagers for Giant Swarm's platform engineering products and services. Focus on communicating clear customer value, addressing pain points, and positioning Giant Swarm's expertise effectively.

---

## Step 1: Product and Audience Discovery

Before writing anything, understand the product and target audience. Ask for anything missing.

**Essential questions:**
- What specific product/service/capability are we marketing?
- Who is the primary target audience? (Platform teams, DevOps engineers, CTOs, etc.)
- What are their main pain points and challenges?
- How does this product specifically address those pain points?
- What makes this offering unique in the market?

**Research and context gathering:**
- Review Giant Swarm's website (giantswarm.io) for current positioning
- Understand how this product fits into Giant Swarm's overall platform engineering story
- Identify direct and indirect competitors and how Giant Swarm's approach differs
- Gather technical details, implementation approach, and proof points

---

## Step 2: Draft the One-Pager

Follow the 6-section structure below. All sections are required.

### Section 1: Opening Hook

Establish the problem context and position Giant Swarm as the strategic solution.

**Structure:**
1. **Problem Statement:** "Platform teams face [specific challenge/choice]..."
2. **Inadequate Alternatives:** "You can [expensive option] or [inadequate option]..."
3. **Giant Swarm Positioning:** "Giant Swarm offers a third, more effective path."

**Requirements:** Start with audience pain point (not product features). Present the "false choice" between two poor alternatives. Position Giant Swarm as the strategic third option.

### Section 2: Value Proposition Statement

**Pattern:**
```
Leverage our deep platform engineering expertise to deploy a [adjective], 
[adjective], and [adjective] [solution type] that is [benefit 1], [benefit 2], 
and [benefit 3]. It's the same battle-tested [solution] we use to [proof point], 
designed to [specific customer benefit].
```

**Key elements:** "Leverage our deep platform engineering expertise" + three adjectives + three benefits + "battle-tested" proof point + specific customer outcome.

### Section 3: Why Giant Swarm

Present 3-4 value propositions from this set:

**Acceleration** (always include):
- "Accelerate Your [Specific Outcome]: [Time/resource benefits]"
- Focus: years of effort → immediate value

**Expertise** (always include):
- "Leverage True Platform Engineering Expertise: [Differentiation]"
- Key phrases: "platform engineering experts, for platform engineering experts", "we live and breathe this"

**Control/Sovereignty** (when relevant):
- "[Maintain/Ensure] [Control/Security/Sovereignty]: [Data/environment control]"
- Focus: your environment, your data, compliance built-in

**Focused Solution** (when relevant):
- "Get the Essentials Without the [Overhead/Complexity]: [Focused approach]"
- Focus: curated essential capabilities vs. bloated enterprise suites

### Section 4: Technical Solution Overview

- Brief intro paragraph positioning the offering
- 3-4 core technical components, each: **Tool/Technology:** Description of managed capability
- Use specific tool names for credibility (Grafana, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Emphasize "we deploy and manage" approach
- Focus on integrated solution, not individual tools

### Section 5: How It Works

**Required 3-step partnership structure:**

1. **Initial Assessment:** "Our engagement starts with a collaborative assessment..." — emphasize partnership and customization
2. **Tailored Deployment and Configuration:** "We deploy and configure into your environment..." — emphasize integration with existing infrastructure
3. **Ongoing Management and Support:** "Giant Swarm provides continuous, hands-on management..." — include "24/7 expert support" and "extension of your team"

### Section 6: Call-to-Action

- **Outcome Question:** "Ready to [achieve specific outcome] without [specific pain point]?"
- **Simple CTA:** "[Contact Us to Learn More]"
- Frame as achieving positive outcome, not just solving problem

## Content Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Professional but Accessible:** Avoid excessive jargon, maintain technical credibility
- **Direct address:** Use "you" and "your" to engage the reader
- **Problem-First:** Always start with customer pain points, not product features
- **Expertise Positioning:** Consistently reference platform engineering expertise

### Key Messaging Themes

| Theme | Focus | Key Phrases |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Time to Value | "years of effort" → "now" | acceleration, immediate benefits, resource reallocation |
| Expertise Transfer | Embedded expertise, not just tools | "we live and breathe this stack", "proven at scale" |
| Control & Sovereignty | Your environment, your data | compliance built-in, avoid vendor lock-in |
| Focused Solutions | Curated vs. comprehensive | "essentials without overhead", platform engineering focus |

### Required Language Patterns
- "Platform engineering expertise" (use consistently)
- "Battle-tested" or "proven at scale" (credibility)
- "Deploy and manage" (service positioning)
- "Extension of your team" (partnership positioning)

### Avoid
- Generic vendor speak ("cutting-edge", "revolutionary")
- Over-technical jargon without context
- Feature lists without customer benefit connection
- Vague benefits without specific outcomes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Feature-First:** Starting with what the product does rather than what problem it solves
2. **Generic Pain Points:** Vague problems instead of specific platform team challenges
3. **Tool Lists:** Disconnected tools rather than integrated solution
4. **Vendor Speak:** Generic marketing language instead of specific, credible benefits
5. **Weak CTAs:** Vague actions instead of outcome-focused next steps
6. **Missing Expertise Positioning:** Failing to emphasize platform engineering differentiation

## What NOT to Include
- Deep technical implementation details (belongs in docs)
- Pricing information (belongs in sales conversations)
- Extensive competitor comparisons
- Complex diagrams or architectures
- Multiple CTAs that dilute the primary action
