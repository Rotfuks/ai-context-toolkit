# Workbench Directory

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory serves as a **temporary workspace** for all artifacts created during development sessions. It acts as a staging area for documents, code snippets, configurations, and other files that may be created while working on the project.

## 📋 General Rules

### ✅ Always Create Artifacts in Workbench First
- **All temporary files** (documents, scripts, configs, etc.) should be created in `/workbench/` initially
- **All experimental code** and draft documents belong here first
- **All session-specific artifacts** start their lifecycle in this directory

### 🚫 Only Move Out When Explicitly Requested
- Files should **only be moved** from workbench to their permanent location when explicitly requested
- **Never assume** where final artifacts should be placed
- **Always ask for clarification** if the permanent location is unclear

### 🗂️ Organization Guidelines
- Use **descriptive filenames** that indicate the purpose and session context
- Create **subdirectories** for related artifacts when working on complex tasks
- Include **timestamps or session identifiers** in filenames when helpful

## 📁 Typical Contents

This directory commonly contains:
- Draft documentation files
- Configuration snippets
- Code examples and prototypes
- Generated reports and summaries
- Temporary data files
- Session-specific notes and references

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Create** all artifacts in `/workbench/` first
2. **Review and iterate** on the content while it's in workbench
3. **Finalize** the artifact based on feedback
4. **Move to permanent location** only when explicitly directed
5. **Clean up** workbench periodically to remove obsolete files

## 🧹 Maintenance

- Workbench files are considered **temporary by nature**
- Periodic cleanup is expected and encouraged
- Important artifacts should be moved to permanent locations promptly when ready
- Session-specific files can be removed after session completion

**💡 Remember**: The workbench is your creative space - use it freely for all temporary work, but always get explicit direction before moving artifacts to their final destinations.
